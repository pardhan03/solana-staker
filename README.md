## 📌 What is Solana Staking?

Staking SOL on Solana means **locking your tokens with a validator** (a trusted computer on the Solana network). This helps secure the blockchain, and in return, **you earn rewards** — just like earning interest in a savings account.

> ✅ You’re not giving your SOL away. You’re just **delegating** it temporarily.

### 🔒 Key Benefits

- 🔐 Your SOL stays in your control
- 💰 Earn ~5–8% APY as rewards
- 🧱 Help keep the Solana network decentralized and fast
- 🔄 You can unstake anytime (with a short cooldown)
